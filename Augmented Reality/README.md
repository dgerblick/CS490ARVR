# Project 4 - Augmented Reality

## Functionality:

### Image Tracking
- When the image is detected, a Grey Alien with Blaster appears
- As the project stands, only one image can be detected. More images could easily be added if desired

### Allow the user to place objects on planes
- Tapping the screen where a plane has been detected causes either a Cube, a Sphere, or a Grey Alien with Blaster to spawn on the plane where the user has tapped

### Basic UI 
- Switch Object Button - Switches the placed object between a Cube, a Sphere, and a Grey Alien with Blaster
- Undo Button - Undos the placement of the last object
